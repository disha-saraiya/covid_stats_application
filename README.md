# COVID-19 Stats Tracker 

This dashboard shows the current situation globally and country-wise for the number of people infected and recovered and the number of deaths due to the Coronavirus pandemic. 
The real time data is fetched from [this](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) API. 
There is also a section dedicated to a few helpful links which include official guidelines by CDC regarding symptoms and practicing social distancing, as well as an Amazon link to buy face masks :-)

(Please note that due to limited testing capacity and API updates, the actual number of cases may be a little different than what is reflected.)
